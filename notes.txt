===CSS Fixes===
- HY
- ID
- KA
- ML
- PT
- TA


===Tool Meeting Notes===
1. Need white icons to replace blue icons on poster page
2. For the selection of languages, would it be helpful to have the full name listed out, or is the lang code better?


=Outstanding project tasks=
1. The CSS still needs lots of tweaks. Certain languages will need special coding
2. Need to implement a way to detect RTL languages for posters. Ask about the orange contact box and where it should be for RTL languages
3. Need to develop a modal for the post-generated edit menu

=Talking Points/Questions=
1. Will there be a formal QA process for this? Will anyone from another team be able to QA this tool? Or will CI be in charge of QA?
2. Is the edit functionaility sufficient for the team's usecase? How could it be better?
3. I believe I'm still on track for June 1st, but the RTL code could be tricky and might extend the due date slightly
4. Form Validation?
5. For RTL languages, where should the orange box be?
